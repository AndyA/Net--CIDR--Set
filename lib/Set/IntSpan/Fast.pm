Set::IntSpan::Fast - Fast handling of sets containing integer spans.

=head1 VERSION

This document describes Set::IntSpan::Fast version 1.11

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Set::IntSpan::Fast;
    
    my $set = Set::IntSpan::Fast->new();
    $set->add(1, 3, 5, 7, 9);
    $set->add_range(100, 1_000_000);
    print $set->as_string(), "\n";    # prints 1,3,5,7,9,100-1000000

=head1 DESCRIPTION

C<Set::IntSpan::Fast> represents sets of integers. It is optimised for
sets that contain contiguous runs of values.

    1-1000, 2000-10000      # Efficiently handled

Sets that don't have this characteristic may still be represented but
some of the performance and storage space advantages will be lost.
Consider using bit vectors if your set does not typically contain
clusters of values.

Sets may be infinite - assuming you're prepared to accept that infinity
is actually no more than a fairly large integer. Specifically the
constants C<Set::IntSpan::Fast::NEGATIVE_INFINITY> and
C<Set::IntSpan::Fast::POSITIVE_INFINITY> are defined to be -(2^31-1) and
(2^31-2) respectively. To create an infinite set invert an empty one:

    my $inf = Set::IntSpan::Fast->new()->complement();

Sets need only be bounded in one direction - for example this is the set
of all positive integers (assuming you accept the slightly feeble
definition of infinity we're using):

    my $pos_int = Set::IntSpan::Fast->new();
    $pos_int->add_range(1, $pos_int->POSITIVE_INFINITY);

=head2 Set representation

The internal representation used is extremely simple: a set is
represented as a list of integers. Integers in even numbered positions
(0, 2, 4 etc) represent the start of a run of numbers while those in odd
numbered positions represent the ends of runs. As an example the set (1,
3-7, 9, 11, 12) would be represented internally as (1, 2, 3, 8, 11, 13).

=head2 Comparision with Set::IntSpan

The C<Set::IntSpan> module represents sets of integers as a number of
inclusive ranges, for example '1-10,19-23,45-48'. Because many of its
operations involve linear searches of the list of ranges its overall
performance tends to be proportional to the number of distinct ranges.
This is fine for small sets but suffers compared to other possible set
representations (bit vectors, hash keys) when the number of ranges
grows large.

This module also represents sets as ranges of values but stores those
ranges in order and uses a binary search for many internal operations
so that overall performance tends towards O log N where N is the number
of ranges.

=cut

use constant POSITIVE_INFINITY => 2**31 - 2;
use constant NEGATIVE_INFINITY => -2**31 + 100;

=head2 C<new>

Create a new set. Any arguments will be processed by a call to
C<add_from_string>:

    my $set = Set::IntSpan::Fast->new( '1, 3, 5, 10-100' );

Because C<add_from_string> handles multiple arguments this will work:

    my @nums = ( 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 );
    my $set = Set::IntSpan::Fast->new( @nums );

Bear in mind though that this validates each element of the array is it
would if you called C<add_from_string> so for large sets it will be
slightly more efficient to create an empty set and then call C<add>.

=cut

sub new {
    my $class = shift;
    my $self = bless [], $class;
    $self->add_from_string( @_ ) if @_;
    return $self;
}

=head2 C<invert>

Complement the set. Because our notion of infinity is actually
disappointingly finite inverting a finite set results in another finite
set. For example inverting the empty set makes it contain all the
integers between C<NEGATIVE_INFINITY> and C<POSITIVE_INFINITY> inclusive.

As noted above C<NEGATIVE_INFINITY> and C<POSITIVE_INFINITY> are actually just
big integers.

=cut

sub invert {
    my $self = shift;

    if ( $self->is_empty() ) {

        # Empty set
        @$self = ( NEGATIVE_INFINITY, POSITIVE_INFINITY );
    }
    else {

        # Either add or remove infinity from each end. The net
        # effect is always an even number of additions and deletions
        if ( $self->[0] == NEGATIVE_INFINITY ) {
            shift @{$self};
        }
        else {
            unshift @{$self}, NEGATIVE_INFINITY;
        }

        if ( $self->[-1] == POSITIVE_INFINITY ) {
            pop @{$self};
        }
        else {
            push @{$self}, POSITIVE_INFINITY;
        }
    }
}

=head2 C<copy>

Return an identical copy of the set.

    my $new_set = $set->copy();

=cut

sub copy {
    my $self = shift;
    my $copy = Set::IntSpan::Fast->new();
    @$copy = @$self;
    return $copy;
}

=head2 C<add( $number ... )>

Add the specified integers to the set. Any number of arguments may be
specified in any order. All arguments must be integers between
C<Set::IntSpan::NEGATIVE_INFINITY> and C<Set::IntSpan::POSITIVE_INFINITY>
inclusive.

=cut

sub add {
    my $self = shift;
    $self->add_range( _list_to_ranges( @_ ) );
}

=head2 C<remove( $number ... )>

Remove the specified integers from the set. It is not an error to remove
non-members. Any number of arguments may be specified.

=cut

sub remove {
    my $self = shift;
    $self->remove_range( _list_to_ranges( @_ ) );
}

=head2 C<add_range( $from, $to )>

Add the inclusive range of integers to the set. Multiple ranges may be
specified:

    $set->add_range(1, 10, 20, 22, 15, 17);

Each pair of arguments constitute a range. The second argument in each
pair must be greater than or equal to the first.

=cut

sub add_range {
    my $self = shift;

    _iterate_ranges(
        @_,
        sub {
            my ( $from, $to ) = @_;

            my $fpos = $self->_find_pos( $from );
            my $tpos = $self->_find_pos( $to + 1, $fpos );

            $from = $self->[ --$fpos ] if ( $fpos & 1 );
            $to   = $self->[ $tpos++ ] if ( $tpos & 1 );

            splice @$self, $fpos, $tpos - $fpos, ( $from, $to );
        }
    );
}

=head2 C<add_from_string( $string )>

Add items to a set from a string representation, of the same form as
C<as_string>. Multiple strings may be supplied:

    $set->add_from_string( '1-10, 30-40', '100-200' );

is equivalent to

    $set->add_from_string( '1-10, 30-40, 100-200' );

By default items are separated by ',' and ranges delimited by '-'. You
may select different punctuation like this:

    $set->add_from_string( 
        { sep => ';', range => ':' },
        '1;3;5;7:11;19:27'
    );
    
When supplying an options hash in this way the C<sep> and C<range>
option may be either a regular expression or a literal string.

    $set->add_from_string( 
        { sep => qr/:+/, range => qr/[.]+/ },
        '1::3::5:7...11:19..27'
    );

And embedded whitespace in the string will be ignored.

=cut

sub add_from_string {
    my $self = shift;

    my $ctl          = {};
    my $match_number = qr/\s* (-?\d+) \s*/x;
    my $match_single = qr/^ $match_number $/x;
    my $match_range;

    my @to_add = ();

    # Iterate args. Default punctuation spec prepended.
    for my $el ( { sep => qr/,/, range => qr/-/, }, @_ ) {

        # Allow parsing options to be set.
        if ( 'HASH' eq ref $el ) {
            %$ctl = ( %$ctl, %$el );
            for ( values %$ctl ) {
                $_ = quotemeta( $_ ) unless ref $_ eq 'Regexp';
            }
            $match_range
              = qr/^ $match_number $ctl->{range} $match_number $/x;
        }
        else {
            for my $part ( split $ctl->{sep}, $el ) {
                if ( my ( $start, $end ) = ( $part =~ $match_range ) ) {
                    push @to_add, $start, $end;
                }
                elsif ( my ( $el ) = ( $part =~ $match_single ) ) {
                    push @to_add, $el, $el;
                }
                else {
                    croak "Invalid range string"
                      unless $part =~ $match_single;
                }
            }
        }
    }

    $self->add_range( @to_add );
}

=head2 C<remove_range( $from, $to )>

Remove the inclusive range of integers from the set. Multiple ranges may
be specified:

    $set->remove_range(1, 10, 20, 22, 15, 17);

=head2 Constants

The constants C<NEGATIVE_INFINITY> and C<POSITIVE_INFINITY> are exposed. As
noted above these are infinitely smaller than infinity but they're the
best we've got. They're not exported into the caller's namespace so if you
want to use them you'll have to use their fully qualified names:

    $set->add_range(1, Set::IntSpan::Fast::POSITIVE_INFINITY);

=head1 DIAGNOSTICS


=head3 C<< Range list must have an even number of elements >>

The lists of ranges passed to C<add_range> and C<remove_range> consist
of a number of pairs of integers each of which specify the start and end
of a range.

=head3 C<< Range limits must be integers >>

You may only add integers to sets.

=head3 C<< Range limits must be in ascending order >>

When specifying a range in a call to C<add_range> or C<remove_range> the
range bounds must be in ascending order. Multiple ranges don't need to
be in any particular order.

=head3 C<< Value out of range >>

Sets may only contain values in the range C<NEGATIVE_INFINITY> to
C<POSITIVE_INFINITY> inclusive.

=head3 C<< That's very kind of you - but I expect you meant complement() >>

The method that complements a set is called C<complement>.

=head3 C<< I need two sets to compare >>

C<superset> and C<subset> need two sets to compare. They may be called
either as a function:

    $ss = Set::IntSpan::Fast::subset( $s1, $s2 )
    
or as a method:

    $ss = $s1->subset( $s2 );

=head3 C<< Invalid Range String >>

The range string must only contain a comma separated list of ranges, with a hyphen used as the range limit separator. e.g. "1,5,8-12,15-29".
